# 👋 Hi, I'm Shrinand Menon

🎓 CS + Business Systems @ RIT  
🧠 I build interfaces and intelligence that solve grounded problems.

I’m focused on designing **clean UIs** and building **machine learning models** that perform under constraint — whether it's offline environments, handwritten inputs, or embedded systems. My goal is to craft **useful, real-world applications** that work where they’re needed most.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus: Interface + Intelligence

I care less about automation and more about **clarity and capability**.  
Every project I build starts with two questions:

- _Can this run simply and clearly?_  
- _Will this actually help someone in the real world?_

## 🚧 Active Projects

### 🔐 Insight Ledger – *AI-Powered E-Passbook App*  
> A secure, intuitive passbook application for real-time and offline financial tracking.

- 📲 **Adaptive UI** using `React`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind`  
- 🧠 **Client-side encryption** with `CryptoJS`  
- 📦 Offline-capable using `IndexedDB`  
- 🛠️ Future: Transaction classification and visual analytics

### ⚡ EV HUD – *Driving Feedback Dashboard*  
> A heads-up display prototype to visualize driving efficiency and energy data in EVs.

- 🚘 Inputs from OBD-II, GPS, CAN Bus  
- 📊 Real-time visualization of regen, acceleration, and consumption  
- 📱 Mobile-first dashboard (Phase I), Raspberry Pi (Phase II)  
- 🎯 Designed for behavioral feedback and energy savings  

---

### 📄 AI Answer Evaluator – *Vision + BERT Scoring Pipeline*  
> A complete academic grading pipeline from image to semantic evaluation.

- 🔍 Text extraction using `Google Vision API`  
- 🧬 Semantic matching with `BERT` embeddings  
- 🎯 Custom scoring logic for exam-style evaluation  
- 🌐 Roadmap: Layout-aware extraction, multilingual grading, feedback UI  

---

## 🛠️ Core Stack

**Frontend/UI**: `React` `TypeScript` `Tailwind CSS` `Lucide`  
**ML/AI**: `Python` `BERT` `Google Vision API` `HuggingFace`  
**Data**: `Pandas` `NumPy` `SQL` `IndexedDB`  
**Workflow**: `GitHub` `Obsidian` `GitHub Actions`

## 💡 Approach

- **Design matters** — Clarity in interface equals clarity in thinking.  
- **Usefulness over novelty** — I prioritize models and UIs that make someone's job easier.  
- **Deploy under constraints** — My builds are meant to *run where the cloud can’t*.
