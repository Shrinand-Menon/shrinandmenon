# 👋 Hi, I'm Shrinand Menon

🎓 CS + Business Systems @ RIT | 
🧠 I design systems that balance code, flow, and intelligence.

I combine no-code automation and GPT where it's efficient — and write code when it's essential.  
My focus: building **scalable, intelligent systems** that solve real-world problems and deliver insights.

## 🧩 Current Focus: Sentiment Pulseboard (WIP)

A hybrid feedback analysis system:
- No-code intake & automation (Google Forms, Zapier, GPT)
- Structured storage (Airtable or Notion)
- Clean insight dashboards (Framer/Typedream)
- Code-based customization when logic or data shaping requires it

🎯 Learning Themes: Prompt Design · Flow Architecture · Insight Visualization · Selective Coding
